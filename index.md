## Program Goals
Students will gain cross-disciplinary knowledge and skills including computer science and engineering, mechanical science and engineering with user interface and model design, time and project management strategies, teamwork, etc. Students will learn how to explain their project workflow with corresponding mechanical and coding knowledge involved. Students will
work cooperatively with their teammates to finish projects. 

Students will be able to apply critical thinking and analytical thinking skills to interpret their projects. Students will be able to demonstrate both written and oral presentation skills to communicate scientific knowledge involved in their projects. Students will improve their creative thinking skills while having fun.
